el kadong's game disassemblies
==============================
For my various badhacks, I've typically worked off of a disassembly of the game.
When the games are small (16-64KB), this is a somewhat reasonable task.

Once the badhack is finished, there's not really much use for the disassembly
unless another hack of the same game is going to be done. I'd rather not see
my work go to waste, so I've tried to collect it in a git repository.

Granted, what's available here isn't exactly what I work with due to copyright
reasons. For example, you will need to provide the graphics tiles yourself for
most (if not all) of the disassemblies here. In some cases, the "graphics
section" of a game could contain data (e.g. the title screen layout in Super
Mario Bros.)... I haven't figured out a good way to handle situations like this.

These disassemblies are provided for informational purposes only.
